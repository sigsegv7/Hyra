Hyra Contribution Guidelines
==============================

!! C PROGRAMMING STYLE !!

The .vimrc file that follows this style can be found in
share/misc/vimrc

Indent width is 4-spaces (NO TABS)

The typename must go above the function name like so:

static inline bool
is_power_of_two(uint8_t n)
{
    if (g_foo) {
        ...
    }

    return ((n & 0x01) == 0);
}

When checking if an integer is 0 or not, *be explicit* unless it is a bool!
Do not do this:

#define BLAH 1

if (!BLAH) {
    ...
}

Do this instead:

if (BLAH == 0) {
    ...
}

-- or if it is a bool:

#define BLAH true

if (!blah) {
    ...
}

--

Now, only use predefined integer types in sys/cdefs.h like so:

uint8_t a;
uint16_t b;
uint32_t c;
--

All includes must be done with '< >':

#include <sys/cdefs.h>
--


When including architecture specific things, it would be stupid
to include for another architecture. Only include from machine/ which
points to the architecture specific files for the current architecture.
For example:

/* AMD64-specific, in sys/include/arch/amd64/lapic.h */
#include <machine/lapic.h>
--

Avoid initializing variables to e.g. 0 unless it seems wise to do so.
Try to avoid this:

uint8_t foo = 0;
...

It is best to do this instead:

uint8_t foo;
...

foo = some_calculation();
--

One of the only times it is best to do that is when you have
a pointer, like, for example:

uint8_t *ptr = NULL;
...

-- or if you have for example, some sort of counter value
   that must have a start:

uint8_t countdown = COUNTDOWN_START;
--

!! COMMIT STYLE !!

Keep commits small if possible. Follow commit good practices.

- Commit examples -
1) Some manpage update:
    docs: man: Describe foo in foobar(9)

2) Adding a tool in tools/
   build: tools: Create foo

   This commit adds a new script in tools/
   that does x and y  ...

- Kernel commits -
An example of a commit title for a non architecture-specific commit:
  kernel: foo: Fix bar in foobar

An example of an architecture specific commit e.g. for AMD64:
kernel/amd64: foo: Add foo in bar

- Ready to commit -

(BE SURE TO TEST IT!! IDEALLY ON REAL HW TOO IF POSSIBLE!)

* Commit with `git commit -sv`
* Create patch with `git format-patch -1 HEAD`
* Email patch to ian@osmora.org and for better response times,
  optionally CC to blazt@osmora.org and bion@osmora.org

Done!

NOTE TO MAINTAINERS

For those who maintain the Hyra repo, when testing a patch, apply it like so:
`git am -s patchfile.patch`. If all good, create a new patch and email it to
ian@osmora.org
