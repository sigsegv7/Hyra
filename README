The Hyra Operating System
=====================

Welcome to the Hyra Operating System project!

Project Goal:
--------------
The goal of this project is to create a modern operating system, taking inspiration from NetBSD and incorporating new ideas and design plans. Our mission is to design a new modernized POSIX-like standard to provide a robust and versatile environment for developers and users.

Getting Started:
----------------
To build Hyra you'll need to bootstrap the project which is essentially just fetching dependencies for the project. This can be done by running the bootstrap script within the project root: `./bootstrap`.

Next, to configure for x86_64 just run configure:

`./configure`

Now you'll need to build the cross compiler by running:

`make cross`

This may take awhile so just sit back, relax and do something else like... well I'm not you so
I don't know what you like.

After the cross compiler is done building you can build and run the project in a virtual machine:

`make; make run`

Documentation:
--------------
Documentation will be in the form of comments throughout the codebase and can also be found in the share/ directory within the project root.
